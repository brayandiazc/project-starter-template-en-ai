## About the `architecture/` vs `conventions/` distinction

- **`architecture/`** describes **this** specific project (its data model, its
  auth, its API).
- **`conventions/`** describes **reusable rules** about how we work
  (how we model data, how we authenticate, how we test) — cross-cutting across
  any feature.

## How to maintain this documentation

- Update the **"Last updated"** line when editing a document.
- Record relevant decisions as [ADRs](decisions/README.md).
- Keep this index up to date if you add or remove documents.
