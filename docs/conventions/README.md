# Conventions

This folder documents **how we work** in [PROJECT_NAME]: cross-cutting
rules and standards that apply to day-to-day work, independent of any specific
feature.

> Difference with `docs/architecture/`: here go the **rules** ("how we model
> data"); in `architecture/` goes **this** project in particular ("what our
> data model is").
