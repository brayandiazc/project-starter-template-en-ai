## AI / Agents

This template is **AI-ready**. Agent context lives in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
(canonical; [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) imports it for Claude Code). Reusable
[subagents](.claude/agents) and [skills](.claude/skills) ship as adaptable
examples, and there's a lightweight spec-driven flow in [`specs/`](specs/README.md).
See [`docs/conventions/ai-agents.md`](docs/conventions/ai-agents.md) for the rules.

## Support

We use [Git](https://git-scm.com) for version control and follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Check the [tags]([REPOSITORY_URL]/tags) for available versions and the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
