#
# The /instantiate prune deletes whole blocks of `.env.example` depending on the
# capabilities the product does NOT have. When ALL of them get pruned —a product
# with no server, no build, with the key living in the user's browser— the README
# is left with two lines telling you to do things that no longer exist:
#
#     cp .env.example .env      # ← there is not a single variable to fill in
#     [MIGRATIONS_COMMAND]      # ← there is no database
#
# And **no check flagged them**, because they are not placeholders: they are
# hardcoded text. They read as correct instructions until somebody runs them. Same
# family as this template's expensive findings: whatever stays plausible and false
# passes green.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-instructions.sh [repo-root]
#
# In TEMPLATE mode (TEMPLATE-USAGE.md exists) it imposes nothing: the template's
# .env.example ships every block and the README is the skeleton that gets pruned.
# Exits 1 if the README prescribes a step the project does not have.
