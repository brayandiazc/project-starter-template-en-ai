#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-hooks-enabled.sh — are this clone's git hooks actually running?
#
# `core.hooksPath` does NOT travel in the repository: it is local config, manual,
# once per clone. So the DEFAULT state of any fresh clone is "no local verification
# at all": `pre-commit` does not format and `pre-push` does not run the checks
# before publishing.
#
# Why this matters more than it looks: on a private repository on the free plan
# **GitHub offers no branch protection**, so the rules CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.md
# declare —PR required, no direct pushes to main/develop— are enforced by nobody. In
# that setup these hooks are the ONLY defense left, and they are the one people
# forget.
#
# This check does not live in CI nor inside `pre-push`, and not by oversight: CI
# cannot see anyone's local config, and putting it in `pre-push` would be circular
# —that hook only runs if the config we want to verify is already set. It is invoked
# by the two skills that touch the moment it gets decided: /instantiate (Step 0) and
# /configure-repo (Step 4).
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-hooks-enabled.sh [repo-root]
#   bash .github/scripts/check-hooks-enabled.sh --fix [repo-root]
#
# Exits 1 if the hooks are not active. Outside a git repo, it has no opinion.
