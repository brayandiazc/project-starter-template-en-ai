#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-inheritance.sh — an instantiated project does not carry the template's life.
#
# Everything product-related (specs/, roadmap, product definition) reaches the user
# empty, but the CHANGELOG and the ADRs can slip through full of the origin
# repository's history. This check prevents that, using a deterministic criterion
# instead of text heuristics:
#
#   `.template-origin` records the instantiation DATE. A project created on day X
#   cannot have versions published nor decisions taken before day X. Anything dated
#   earlier is inherited and does not belong.
#
# It checks three things:
#   1. CHANGELOG.md with no versions older than the instantiation.
#   2. docs/decisions/ with no ADRs older than the instantiation (except 0001, the
#      canonical ADR on why decisions are recorded: that one is inherited).
#   3. No files that only make sense in the template repository.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-inheritance.sh [repo-root]
#
# The template itself has no `.template-origin`, so nothing is enforced there: it
# only acts on already instantiated projects. Exits 1 if it finds inheritance.
