# check-inheritance.sh — an instantiated project does not drag the template's life.
#
# Everything product-related (specs/, roadmap, definition) reaches the user empty, but
# the CHANGELOG and the ADRs slipped through full of the origin repository's history.
# This check prevents that, and uses a deterministic criterion instead of text
# heuristics:
#
#   `.template-origin` stores the instantiation DATE. A project created on day X
#   cannot have versions published or decisions taken before day X. Anything dated
#   earlier is inheritance and does not belong.
#
# It verifies three things:
#   1. CHANGELOG.md with no versions predating instantiation.
#   2. docs/decisions/ with no ADRs predating instantiation (except 0001, which is
#      the canonical ADR on why decisions are recorded: that one is inherited).
#   3. None of the files exclusive to the template repo.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-inheritance.sh [repo-root]
#   bash .github/scripts/check-inheritance.sh --publishable-version [repo-root]
#
# In the template itself there is no `.template-origin`, so it imposes nothing: it
# only acts on already instantiated projects. Exits 1 if it finds inheritance.

# --publishable-version: is the topmost CHANGELOG version one of THIS project?
# Exits 1 if it belongs to the template. It is consulted by release.yml (before
# creating the tag) and check-release.sh (before merging into main).
#
# It exists because publishing `main` before resetting the CHANGELOG publishes the
# TEMPLATE's release, and nothing caught it: /instantiate creates `main` in Step 0
# pointing at the initial commit —with the inherited CHANGELOG— and the push fires
# release.yml, which sees the topmost version, checks it has no tag, and publishes
# it with another repository's notes. The prune says `git tag -d`, but the tag does
# not exist yet when that runs: the push creates it, two steps later.
#
# And the expensive part comes later: the day the project reaches its own 1.0.0,
# release.yml will say "it already has a tag" and skip that release SILENTLY.
# A failure planted today that gets collected a year from now.
