# check-changelog.sh — makes the "nothing undocumented" rule verifiable: every PR
# that changes something in the project must bring its entry in CHANGELOG.md under
# `## [Unreleased]` (docs/conventions/workflow.md, rule 5).
#
# What counts as enough:
#   - the PR modifies CHANGELOG.md, AND
#   - the `## [Unreleased]` section has at least one bullet,
#   - or the PR is a version cut (it adds `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`), which leaves
#     Unreleased empty on purpose.
#
# Exemptions:
#   - PRs that only touch `specs/` (the spec precedes the code; the changelog arrives
#     with the implementation) or only CHANGELOG.md itself.
#   - PRs with the `no-changelog` label (pass it in PR_LABELS, comma-separated).
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-changelog.sh [base-ref] [repo-root]
#   PR_LABELS="no-changelog,docs" bash .github/scripts/check-changelog.sh main
#
# Requires: git. Exits 1 if the entry is missing. On an unresolvable base-ref it
# fails OPEN (exit 0): CI is not the place to guess the diff.
