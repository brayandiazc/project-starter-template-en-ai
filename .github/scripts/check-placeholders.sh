#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-placeholders.sh — verifies the template's `[LIKE_THIS]` placeholders.
#
# Two auto-detected modes:
#   - TEMPLATE mode (TEMPLATE-USAGE.md exists): every placeholder used in the repo
#     must be documented in the TEMPLATE-USAGE.md catalog (§3), either literally or
#     covered by a wildcard such as `[COMMAND_*]`.
#   - INSTANCE mode (TEMPLATE-USAGE.md was deleted): no placeholder may be left
#     unfilled, except in the intentional skeletons and except the ones marked as
#     PENDING (see below).
#
# Pending placeholders: when instantiating there is data that legitimately cannot be
# inferred (a security mailbox, a URL that does not exist yet). The /instantiate rule
# is "do not invent data", so those are left — but marked:
#
#     - **Security email**: [SECURITY_EMAIL] <!-- pending: no mailbox yet -->
#
# A placeholder with a pending mark on its line —or on the immediately following one,
# because Prettier splits lines inside code fences— does not fail; the rest do.
# The mark is accepted in the three comment syntaxes that appear in the repo, because
# placeholders also live inside ```bash fences and in .env.example, where an HTML
# comment would show up literally:
#
#     [SECURITY_EMAIL] <!-- pending: no mailbox -->     markdown
#     [TEST_COMMAND]    # pending: scaffolding missing  bash, .env
#     [VIEWS_PATH]      // pending                      js/ts
# That is how what you decided to leave is told apart from what you forgot, which was
# the contradiction between "do not invent data" and "none may be left".
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-placeholders.sh [repo-root]
#   bash .github/scripts/check-placeholders.sh --fillable-paths [root]
#
# Requires: git, perl. Exits 1 if it finds problems.

#     rewriting the past to silence a check would be the opposite of what a changelog

#
# They are only checked in INSTANCE mode: in template mode they are legitimate —the

#   ```…```           code blocks             → what is inside is quoted code, not prose
# That last one is not a detail: normal Mermaid syntax uses brackets for its nodes
# —`A["Host"]`, `Start([Entry])`— and the template recommends Mermaid diagrams in
# architecture.md, database.md and screens.md, so without this exclusion the clash was
# guaranteed in every instance and pushed people to deform the diagrams (rounded nodes
# just to please the check). [UPPERCASE] placeholders are NOT exempted:
