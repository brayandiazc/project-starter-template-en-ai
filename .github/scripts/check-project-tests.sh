#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-project-tests.sh — runs the PROJECT's tests, not the template's.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS:
#   `.github/scripts/tests/run-tests.sh` tests this template's hooks and scripts.
#   Those tests survive instantiation and keep passing forever, no matter what the
#   product does. Measured on a real start: with the main algorithm broken —it
#   recommended the most expensive provider— and two project tests red, `pre-push`
#   said "✅ Test suite · all green".
#
#   A ✅ that does not test the product is worse than having no check: it gives false
#   confidence at exactly the moment you decide to open the PR.
#
# HOW IT KNOWS WHAT TO RUN:
#   The test command is declared in AGENTS.md → "Setup & commands". It is read from
#   there so there is no second copy to drift out of sync.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/check-project-tests.sh [repo-root]
#
# Exits 1 if the project tests fail. If the project has no tests yet it warns and
# passes — but it SAYS SO, which is the difference between "nothing to test" and
# "everything passes".

# The command comes from a file in the repo and in CI it runs on PR events. This
# allowlist is a SPEED BUMP, not a barrier: it reduces obvious abuse and accidents,
# but a legitimate runner also executes repo code (npm test runs whatever
# package.json says). The real containment is the `pull_request` token: read-only
# and without secrets. Rules:
#   - `VAR=value` prefixes are ignored for classification (RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails
#     test is a normal test command) but they run with the command.
#   - A COMPOUND command (;, &&, ||, |, `, $( ) is not classified: it is skipped
#     with a warning — the allowed prefix says nothing about the rest of the line.
#   - An unknown runner does not fail the check, but it says so (explicit fail-open).
