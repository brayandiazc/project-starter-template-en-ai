# CI/CD workflows

This repository's [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) workflows.

## Active (stack-agnostic)

They work as-is, whatever the project's language — do not delete them when instantiating:

- [`quality.yml`](quality.yml) — documentation and tooling health: Markdown formatting
  (Prettier), internal links, placeholders, skills and agents frontmatter, raw colors in
  the views, template inheritance, that `develop` exists on the remote, that no
  workflow claims to be another repository, the [`../scripts/`](../scripts) test
  suite and, on
  every PR, the `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [Unreleased]` — the `no-changelog` label
  is the explicit exception. On PRs toward `main` it adds the release step: nothing
  reaches production without a cut version.
- [`secret-scan.yml`](secret-scan.yml) — history scanning with
  [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks).
- [`release.yml`](release.yml) — on merging into `main`, it creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag and
  the GitHub release with that changelog section's notes. **It does not publish a version
  inherited from the template** (it consults `check-inheritance.sh --publishable-version`):
  a `main` published before resetting the CHANGELOG created a foreign tag that later made
  the project's own release disappear silently.
- [`template-update-check.yml`](template-update-check.yml) — **it only acts on
  instantiated projects** (it needs `.template-origin`). Weekly it compares the tooling
  with the origin template's and opens an issue if there are improvements. To apply them:
  `/update-template`.

## Included skeleton

- [`ci.yml.example`](ci.yml.example) — a neutral pipeline (lint → test → build). The
  `.example` extension goes **last on purpose**: GitHub runs any `.yml`/`.yaml` file
  living in this folder, no matter what else the name carries. `/instantiate` renames it
  to `ci.yml` and replaces the `[*_COMMAND]` placeholders with the chosen stack's. Until
  then, the repository runs no code tests — only the documentation checks.

## Rules of this folder

**If a file must not run, it cannot end in `.yml` or `.yaml`.** GitHub runs any file
that lives here, no matter what else the name carries. The test suite verifies it.

**One job per workflow unless there is a measured reason to split it.** GitHub bills each
job rounding up to the minute, so nine two-second jobs cost nine minutes. `quality.yml`
used to run that way and is now a single job with `!cancelled()` on every step —you still
see every failure at once— plus `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress`. Splitting only
makes sense when a step really takes time and blocks the others.

**One run per change, not two.** `quality.yml` triggers **only on `pull_request`**:
GitHub runs those events against the _simulated merge commit_, so the run that fired on
merging checked the same tree again. It was half the repository's runs. `secret-scan.yml`
does keep `push` on `main`, because without branch protection nothing technically stops a
direct push to production and there the history scan is a real backstop.

**The first filter is local.** The `.githooks/pre-push` hook runs these same checks in
~15 seconds before publishing, so CI is the safety net and not the verification loop (see
`docs/conventions/quality-tooling.md`).

> **The cost of this, plainly:** a commit that reaches `develop` **without going through
> a PR** is verified by nobody on the server. It is prevented by `git-guardrails.sh`
> (only inside Claude Code) and `pre-push` (only if that clone has `core.hooksPath` set).
> If one day there is branch protection —it requires a public repo or a Pro plan— that is
> the barrier that really closes the gap.
